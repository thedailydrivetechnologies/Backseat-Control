All communication between devices happens locally within the same Wi-Fi network.

Camera data is processed in real time and is never stored, recorded, or transmitted.

3. Network Permission

The App requires internet and network permissions to:
- Establish local WebSocket communication between devices
- Detect devices connected to the same local network

No data is transmitted to external servers operated by Daily Drive Technologies.

4. Children’s Privacy

Backseat Control does not knowingly collect personal information from children or any users.

5. Local Data Storage

The App may store basic local preferences (such as language settings) directly on the device.  
This data never leaves the device.

Google Play may collect standard technical information as part of its platform services.  
Please refer to Google’s Privacy Policy for details.
